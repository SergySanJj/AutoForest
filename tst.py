"""
Demonstrates how you could easily do complex conversations.
This conversation consists of the following:
You send
> /start
The bot welcomes you, and asks for your name
You send your name
> Luckydonald
The bot asks you for your age
> 4458
The bots replies with your name and age.
You are done, you now can continue from the beginning.
(after your `/start` until you are done, everyone else will only get a message, saying the bot is currently in use by another user)
